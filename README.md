# JuriXAI ⚖️

JuriXAI is an on-chain hackathon hosting platform built for the Lepton Agents Hackathon. It replaces human judges with a panel of AI agents, using USDC micropayments on Arc L1 Testnet to pay agents for evaluations and distribute prize pools to winners.

The platform uses Circle Smart Accounts (SCA) to provide developer and organizer wallets.

## Features
*   **AI Judges:** 4 specialized agent profiles (Technical Quality, Product Value, Originality, and Presentation) score submissions. Scoring is deterministic (temperature 0.0).
*   **Workload-based Fees & Agent Wallets:** Every AI agent has an individual EVM wallet. Agent workload fees are calculated dynamically based on the character length of the project details and their generated response (base fee of `0.0002 USDC` + `0.000001 USDC` per character). These fees are transferred from the escrow contract to the scoring agent's wallet address on-chain on every project evaluation.
*   **Dynamic Explorer Links:** Clickable Arcscan transaction links appear directly under each judge's score on the project page.
*   **On-Chain Escrow Smart Contract:** Hackathons require organizers to fund the prize pool and platform fee upon creation. The funds are sent to a secure **`JuriXEscrow`** smart contract on-chain. The contract instantly forwards the platform fees to the fee collector and locks the prize pool inside the contract.
*   **Automated Atomic Prize Payouts:** Once judging is closed (either manually by an admin or automatically when a deadline passes), the platform autonomously triggers the smart contract payout. The contract distributes the locked rewards atomically in a single contract call to the winners EVM addresses based on the configured split (e.g. 50/30/20) with no human in the loop.
*   **Circle Smart Accounts:** Login via email OTP and set up a PIN. Developers can withdraw their balance directly to Metamask or other external wallets by completing a PIN challenge.

## Environment Variables (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```

## Smart Contract Escrow (JuriXEscrow)
The platform uses a master escrow contract deployed on **Arc Testnet** at:
`0x89db74b925f694ebec1118cff9b08a1afe528785`

The Solidity source code for the escrow is located at `scripts/deploy-escrow.ts`.

## Supabase Database Setup
Create a new SQL query in the Supabase Dashboard and run:

```sql
alter table public.judge_agents
  add column if not exists wallet_address text;

update public.judge_agents set wallet_address = '0xE6FC925Ff22e972F1D819b93b968Dc4B69ce9629' where slug = 'vex-01';
update public.judge_agents set wallet_address = '0x9F4d3272f88180154f1c97aCa3491f3Baa8EfFa1' where slug = 'kael-02';
update public.judge_agents set wallet_address = '0x126BD7Ca8268708e62fb778EeA5910855D13E73C' where slug = 'oryn-03';
update public.judge_agents set wallet_address = '0x1F996D3ecFAF4b3348451959d4f8fA8274686d53' where slug = 'zera-04';
```

## How to Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## OKX.AI Reviewer Startup

OKX/Claude reviewer sessions must start without dangerous permission bypass flags when the runtime user is `root` or uses `sudo`. Claude CLI rejects options such as `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in privileged sessions, which prevents the review agent from starting and can make the service appear unresponsive.

Use the normal non-bypass startup path instead:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

For CLI smoke tests, also avoid bypass flags:

```bash
claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits "Reply with the single word OK."
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write "Reply with the single word OK."
```

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility Note (Chrome/Safari/Brave)
Because Circle's secure wallet SDK relies on cross-origin iframes (`w3s.circle.com`) to manage device authentication and store keys securely:
*   **Brave Browser (PC):** Works perfectly out-of-the-box on PC. We highly recommend using Brave Browser for a seamless experience.
*   **Chrome & Safari (PC):** If you experience an "Account/wallet error" or if device registration fails, your browser's **Third-Party Cookie Blocking** settings are likely blocking the SDK from writing to local storage. You can resolve this by allowing third-party cookies for the site in your Chrome/Safari settings.

## Quick Demo Flow
1. **Sign In:** Click "Sign In", input email, verify OTP, and set a PIN. This generates your Circle Smart Account (SCA).
2. **Host a Hackathon:** Go to `/create` (requires login). Set prize splits and details.
3. **Execute Payment:** Upon clicking "Deploy Hackathon", verify your smart account balance, execute the on-chain transfer directly to the smart contract escrow, and authorize it. The hackathon will be deployed and fully funded immediately.
4. **Submit:** Log in as a developer, submit a project, and the payout address is pre-filled from your wallet.
5. **Run Judging:** In the admin page (`/admin`), click "Run judging". This triggers LLM scoring and pays agent fees on-chain.
6. **Verify Payouts:** Under each score on the project detail page, click the green "Fee Paid" link to check the transaction on Arcscan.
7. **Automated Disbursement:** Once judging is triggered and completed, the platform instantly and automatically distributes rewards to the winners on-chain. The admin page also includes a manual "Disburse Prizes" button as a fallback if needed.
8. **Withdraw Winnings:** Winnings will show in the user's dashboard. Go to `/profile`, click "Withdraw", type recipient address and amount, enter PIN, and the funds are sent to your external wallet.

## Automated Autonomous Judging
The platform operates fully autonomously when hackathon deadlines pass:
*   **Cron Trigger Endpoint:** `/api/judge-deadlines` (accepts both `GET` and `POST` requests).
*   **Vercel Crons:** Configured in `vercel.json` to automatically invoke the endpoint every 10 minutes.
*   **Logic:** The endpoint triggers `runExpiredHackathons()`, which retrieves all `open` hackathons where the deadline is in the past, spins up the LLM evaluation runs, saves the scores, marks the hackathon closed, and immediately triggers the on-chain payout disbursement to the winners autonomously.
