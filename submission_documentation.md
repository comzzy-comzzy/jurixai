# Ignites Submission Documentation: JurixAI ⚖️

This document contains the submission details for **JurixAI** for the Circle Ignites program.

## 1. Project Title
**JuriXAI: Autonomous Agentic Hackathon Judging & Escrow Protocol**

---

## 2. Description
JuriXAI is an autonomous, on-chain hackathon management and evaluation protocol. It eliminates the standard bottlenecks of traditional hackathons—subjective judging, evaluation fatigue, coordination delays, and slow, manual prize disbursements—by replacing human judges with a panel of specialized, deterministic AI agents and utilizing Circle Smart Accounts (SCA) alongside secure smart-contract escrows.

### Core Value Propositions:
*   **Objectivity & Consistency:** A panel of 4 specialized AI agents evaluate projects on deterministic parameters (temperature 0.0) based on code execution, product value, originality, and completeness of shipping.
*   **Economic Cycle (Agent Incentives):** Micro-payments in USDC are sent directly to the EVM wallets of the scoring agents on-chain, aligning the cost of compute with project complexity.
*   **Atomic Disbursements:** Organizers deploy hackathons and fund them in one transaction. Winning payouts are triggered and distributed automatically in a single atomic smart contract call based on host-defined splits (e.g., 50/30/20).
*   **Seamless Onboarding:** Circle Smart Accounts allow email OTP login and set up secure wallets without requiring private key management.

## 5. Products Used
*   **Circle Smart Accounts (SCA):** Used to generate ERC-4337 smart-contract wallets for both organizers and developers. This handles PIN-challenge authentication, secure transaction signing, and balance withdrawals.
*   **Circle User-Controlled Wallets SDK / API:** Integrates the cross-origin iframe security model and email OTP authentication for frictionless Web3 onboarding.
*   **Circle Programmable Wallets:** Used on the backend to facilitate wallet listings, balance queries, and transaction setups.
*   **USDC Stablecoin Integration:** All economic actions (escrow funding, developer prize payouts, and agent workload fees) are denominated and paid in USDC stablecoin on Arc Network.

*   **Local Port Details:** Accessible locally on `http://localhost:3000` via Vite + React.
*   **Smart Contract Deployment:**

## 8. Documentation

### 8.1 Setup and Installation
To run the platform locally, follow these steps:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start the local server
npm run dev

# 3. Access the dashboard
# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### 8.2 API Endpoints
*   `/api/judge-deadlines`: Cron trigger endpoint (runs every 10 minutes) that checks for past-deadline hackathons, triggers LLM analysis, saves scores, pays agents, and prepares payouts.

### 8.3 Autonomous Workload Fee Algorithm
To compensate judging agents for compute and gas costs, they receive a dynamically calculated USDC fee:
$$\text{Fee (USDC)} = 0.0002 + (\text{Description Length} + \text{Rationale Length}) \times 0.000001$$
*   **0.0002 USDC Base Fee:** Covers database overhead, Web3 transaction fees, and general connection logic.
*   **0.000001 USDC / character:** Dynamically scales to the text input length (project description) and agent output length (detailed rationale).

### 8.4 Evaluation Rubric & Flag Penalties
Agents will raise flags if deliverables are missing, automatically reducing score:
*   `missing_repo`: Raised by Vex (Code Judge) if no GitHub link exists. Autoreduces score to 1.00.
*   `weak_readme`: Raised by Zera (Delivery Judge) if README is sparse or default. Penalizes score by 3.0 points.
*   `missing_demo`: Raised by Kael (Product Judge) if no demo URL is included. Penalizes score by 4.0 points.

## 9. Product Feedback (Circle SDK/APIs)

1.  **Third-Party Cookie Dependency:** Because Circle's secure wallet SDK renders cross-origin iframes (`w3s.circle.com`) to write keys to storage, browsers that block third-party cookies by default (Brave, Safari, and strict Chrome configurations) fail during PIN and registration challenges. Emitting developer-friendly error codes or providing an alternative fallback flow would improve the UX.
2.  **Silent SDK Hanging on Out-of-Order Calls:** If developers execute a wallet operation (e.g. `createWallet`) before the user has generated a PIN challenge, the SDK hangs silently without returning a rejection or error. Explicit exception messages would drastically improve debugging times.
3.  **Unified Paymaster (Gas Sponsorship) Portal:** While programmable wallets make transactions easy, setting up gas sponsorships on new L2 networks or custom EVM chains (like Arc Network) remains complex. A unified portal inside the Circle developer console to fund/sponsor gas on any EVM chain would accelerate deployment.
4.  **Local SDK Simulation:** Adding a mocking library or local sandbox environment for testing the PIN challenge-response flow offline (without making live sandbox API calls) would allow developers to run robust CI/CD pipelines.
